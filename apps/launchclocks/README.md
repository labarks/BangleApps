# launchclocks

This is a copy of the default [**Launcher** (launch) app] (https://banglejs.com/apps/#launcher) with the [Clocks] (https://banglejs.com/apps/#clock) seperated into a sub-menu. 

Screen shots: ![Apps menu with Clocks app](screenshot1.png) ![Clocks sub-menu](screenshot2.png)

## Usage

Great for users that want to have multiple [Clocks] (https://banglejs.com/apps/#clock) to switch between. Great addition to use with the [**Random Clock Loader** (rndmclk)] (https://banglejs.com/apps/#rndmclk) app. To use: install [*launchclocks*] (https://banglejs.com/apps/#launchclocks) app and uninstall the [**Launcher** app] (https://banglejs.com/apps/#launcher).

## Features

Same as default [**Launcher** (launch) app] (https://banglejs.com/apps/#launcher), but doesn't list apps with *clock* type. Instead, it creates the **Clocks** app that you can select to then list just *clock*-type apps and then can select a clock from the list to use that clock.
